This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments in the paper.

> We propose DeePM (Deep Portfolio Manager), a structured deep-learning macro portfolio manager trained end-to-end to maximize a robust, risk-adjusted utility. DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous "ragged filtration" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) — a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010–2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent. The model demonstrates structural resilience across the 2010s "CTA Winter" and the post-2020 volatility regime shift, maintaining consistent performance through the pandemic, inflation shocks, and the subsequent higher-for-longer environment. Ablation studies confirm that strictly lagged cross-sectional attention, graph prior, principled treatment of transaction costs, and robust minimax optimization are the primary drivers of this generalization capability.

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python >= 3.10, CUDA-capable GPU recommended.
All experiments in the paper were performed on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24 GB).

```bash
# recommended: create a virtual environment with uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
uv venv .venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .

# alternatively, with plain pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### Weights & Biases (wandb)

Training uses [wandb](https://wandb.ai) for experiment tracking and hyperparameter sweeps.

**First-time setup:**

1. Create a free account at [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai).
2. Create a project called **`dmn`** in your wandb workspace (this is the project name referenced by all training configs).
3. Set your credentials:

```bash
export WANDB_ENTITY="your-wandb-username"
export WANDB_API_KEY="your-api-key"       # or run `wandb login`
```

To run training without a wandb account, use offline mode:

```bash
export WANDB_MODE=offline
```

## Data

### Raw data (`data/data_dec25.parquet`)

The raw data is not included in this repository due to data provider licensing
restrictions. You will need to source equivalent daily closing prices yourself
(e.g. from Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or a futures data vendor).

The pipeline expects a **wide-format price panel** saved as a Parquet file:

- **Index:** `DatetimeIndex` of trading dates (business days, 1990-01-02 to 2025-12-31)
- **Columns:** 50 short ticker codes (see table below)
- **Values:** Daily closing (settlement) prices for continuous front-month futures contracts

The column tickers map to the following 50 assets:

| Group | Ticker | Asset |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Equities** | `EN` | Nasdaq 100 |
| | `ER` | Russell 2000 |
| | `ES` | S&P 500 |
| | `YM` | Dow Jones |
| | `LX` | FTSE 100 |
| | `CA` | CAC 40 |
| | `XU` | EuroStoxx 50 |
| | `NK` | Nikkei 225 |
| | `HS` | Hang Seng |
| **Rates** | `FB` | US 5-Year Note |
| | `TU` | US 2-Year Note |
| | `TY` | US 10-Year Note |
| | `US` | US 30-Year Bond |
| | `DT` | German Bund (10yr) |
| | `UB` | German Bobl (5yr) |
| | `UZ` | German Schatz (2yr) |
| | `GS` | UK Gilt |
| | `CB` | Canada 10-Year |
| **Energy** | `BC` | Brent Crude |
| | `BG` | Gasoil |
| | `ZB` | RBOB Gasoline |
| | `ZN` | Natural Gas |
| | `ZU` | WTI Crude |
| **Metals** | `ZA` | Palladium |
| | `ZG` | Gold |
| | `ZI` | Silver |
| | `ZP` | Platinum |
| | `ZK` | Copper |
| **Agriculture** | `KW` | KC Wheat |
| | `ZC` | Corn |
| | `ZL` | Soybean Oil |
| | `ZM` | Soybean Meal |
| | `ZS` | Soybeans |
| | `ZW` | Chicago Wheat |
| | `CC` | Cocoa |
| | `CT` | Cotton |
| | `JO` | Orange Juice |
| | `KC` | Coffee |
| | `SB` | Sugar |
| **Livestock** | `ZF` | Feeder Cattle |
| | `ZT` | Live Cattle |
| | `ZZ` | Lean Hogs |
| **FX** | `AN` | AUD/USD |
| | `BN` | GBP/USD |
| | `CN` | CAD/USD |
| | `FN` | EUR/USD |
| | `JN` | JPY/USD |
| | `SN` | CHF/USD |
| | `MP` | MXN/USD |
| | `DX` | US Dollar Index |

**Example (first few rows and columns):**

```
              AN       BC       BN       CA  ...
1990-01-02  0.7745  20.65    1.6312   3245  ...
1990-01-03  0.7738  20.80    1.6298   3240  ...
1990-01-04  0.7721  20.72    1.6285   3238  ...
```

Missing values (e.g. for contracts that started trading after 1990) should be left
as `NaN`; the feature pipeline handles them automatically.

### Feature preparation

The feature preparation step (`scripts/prepare_features.py`) converts the raw price
panel into a long-format DataFrame with all model inputs.

> **Note:** The pipeline computes a comprehensive feature set, but each training
> configuration uses only a subset specified in its `features` list. The main
> DeePM-GAT model uses six features: `r1d, r1m, r3m, r1y, z_price_21d,
> z_price_252d` (four normalised momentum returns + two price z-scores). The MACD
> ablation replaces the momentum returns with MACD signals. Refer to individual
> configs in `configs/train_settings/` for the exact feature set used by each model.

Available columns in the prepared feature file:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ticker` | Asset identifier |
| `close` | Closing price |
| `target` | Next-day return (prediction target) |
| `r1d`, `r1w`, `r1m`, `r3m`, `r6m`, `r1y` | Normalized momentum features at various horizons |
| `macd_4_12`, `macd_8_24`, `macd_16_48`, `macd_32_96` | MACD signals |
| `z_price_*`, `z_ret_*` | Z-scored price/return features |
| `log_vol`, `log_vol_252d`, `z_log_vol_252d` | Volatility features |
| `skew_63d`, `kurt_63d` | Higher-moment features |
| `dd_252d`, `dd_63d`, `time_since_1y_high` | Drawdown features |
| `cs_pct_*`, `cs_z_*` | Cross-sectional rank/z-score features |
| `vs_factor` | Volatility scaling factor |

### Transaction costs (`configs/tcost/`)

The file `configs/tcost/futs_and_fx.csv` provides per-asset transaction cost
estimates used by the training loss and the backtest engine.  Each row
corresponds to one futures contract:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ticker` | Short ticker code (matches the data and config files). |
| `description` | Human-readable contract name. |
| `bloomberg_ticker` | Bloomberg identifier. |
| `group` | Sector/asset-class label (e.g. `EQUITY_US`, `COMM_ENERGY`, `FX_G10`). |
| `open_utc`, `close_utc` | Trading session times (UTC). |
| `transaction_cost` | Half bid-ask spread in basis points — the primary value used by the pipeline. |

To use your own cost estimates, create a CSV with the same schema and point
`ticker_reference_file` in your configs to its filename (without path — the
loader looks in `configs/tcost/`).

## Reproduction

### Quick Start

```bash
bash scripts/reproduce.sh                # run full pipeline (train + backtest + tables)
bash scripts/reproduce.sh --step 2       # run a single step (see below)
bash scripts/reproduce.sh --baselines    # traditional baselines only (no GPU / no training)
bash scripts/smoke_test.sh               # fast end-to-end check (5 HP trials, 5 seeds, 1 window)
bash scripts/smoke_test.sh --baselines   # smoke baselines only
```

> **Note:** The smoke test uses drastically reduced settings (5 HP trials, 5 seeds,
> single 2020–2025 test window) and exists **only to verify the pipeline runs
> end-to-end without errors**.  Smoke metrics are not meaningful and should not be
> compared to the paper results.  Use `scripts/reproduce.sh` for publishable numbers.

The pipeline steps are:

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Generate macro adjacency matrix (`scripts/build_graph.py`) |
| 2 | Prepare features from raw prices (`scripts/prepare_features.py`) |
| 3 | Train all DL models — DeePM variants + Momentum Transformer (HP sweep via wandb) |
| 4 | Run backtests for all models including traditional baselines, and generate diagnostics |
| 5 | Aggregate metrics into paper-style tables and save CSV |

### Step-by-step

**1. Generate adjacency matrix**

```bash
python scripts/build_graph.py
```

Produces `macro_adjacency_normalized.csv` encoding macro-economic relationships between assets.

**2. Prepare features**

```bash
python scripts/prepare_features.py --input data/data_dec25.parquet
```

**3. Train models**

```bash
# Main model (DeePM-GAT)
python -m deepm.training -r "deepm-gat" -a DeePM

# Temporal baseline (Momentum Transformer)
python -m deepm.training -r "temporal-baseline" -a AdvancedTemporalBaseline
```

**4. Run backtests**

```bash
# DeePM-GAT
python -m deepm.backtest --name "bt-deepm-gat" --diagnostics

# Traditional baselines
python -m deepm.backtest --name "bt-baseline-tsmom" --diagnostics
```

## Training Configuration Reference

Each YAML file in `configs/train_settings/` defines the full specification for a
training run.  Settings fall into five categories: **architecture**, **loss /
optimisation**, **data**, **training loop**, and **asset universe**.  Hyperparameters
marked *(swept)* are overridden by the companion sweep config referenced via
`sweep_yaml`.

### General

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `sweep_yaml` | str | Name of the sweep config in `configs/sweep_settings/` (defines the HP grid). |
| `save_directory` | str | Root directory for model checkpoints (default `models_torch`). |
| `project` | str | Wandb project name. |
| `test_run` | bool | If `true`, run a tiny sanity-check loop instead of full training. |

### Architecture

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `use_lagged_cross_section` | bool | Enable the cross-sectional (multi-asset) dataset with a one-step causal lag between the key/value assets and the query asset (the "Directed Delay" / Causal Sieve mechanism from the paper). |
| `use_staggered_close_kv` | bool | Use a staggered-close key/value alignment (experimental variant of the causal lag). Requires `use_lagged_cross_section: true`. |
| `use_xatt` | bool | Enable cross-asset multi-head attention. |
| `use_gnn` | bool | Enable the graph neural network (GNN) layer that encodes macro-economic relationships. |
| `use_rezero_attn` | bool | Apply ReZero initialisation to the attention residual connections (init scale = `rezero_init`). |
| `use_rezero_gnn` | bool | Apply ReZero initialisation to the GNN residual connections. |
| `rezero_init` | float | Initial scalar for ReZero gates (default `0.01`). |
| `gat_concat_heads` | bool | Concatenate (rather than average) GAT attention heads. |
| `use_single_head_spatial` | bool | Use a single attention head in the spatial (GNN) layer regardless of `num_heads`. |
| `gnn_weighted_edges` | bool | Allow the GNN to learn edge weights on the adjacency matrix. |
| `no_bias_in_prediction_head` | bool | Remove bias from the final prediction linear layer. |
| `prediction_head_init` | str | Initialisation mode for the prediction head: `"default"` (Kaiming), `"zero"`, or `"near_zero"`. |
| `prediction_head_std` | float | Standard deviation when using `"default"` init (default `0.001`). |
| `use_static_ticker` | bool | Provide a learnable per-asset embedding to the model (used in the temporal baseline). |

### Loss and Optimisation

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `optimise_loss_function` | int | Loss function selector. `0` = differentiable Sharpe ratio (default for all configs in this repo). |
| `use_joint_pooled_softmin_sharpe` | bool | Enable the joint objective: pooled Sharpe + λ × SoftMin window Sharpe (the robust minimax proxy from the paper). |
| `joint_softmin_lambda` | float | λ weight on the SoftMin penalty in the joint objective. |
| `softmin_sharpe_beta` | float | β temperature for the SoftMin operator (larger = closer to hard min). |
| `softmin_sharpe_center` | bool | Subtract a log-normalisation constant from the SoftMin (no gradient effect). |
| `use_softmin_sharpe` | bool | Use pure SoftMin Sharpe (without the pooled term). Mutually exclusive with `use_joint_pooled_softmin_sharpe`. |
| `use_adamw` | bool | Use AdamW optimiser (vs. Adam). |
| `alpha_lr_mult` | float | Learning rate multiplier for ReZero α parameters (default `100.0`). |
| `grad_accum_hidden_threshold` | int | Trigger two-pass gradient accumulation when `hidden_dim` exceeds this threshold. Splits the batch into `hidden_dim // threshold` chunks for memory efficiency while preserving exact gradients for the coupled Sharpe objective. |
| `grad_accum_ratio` | int | Explicit number of chunks for gradient accumulation (default `1` = disabled). Overridden by `grad_accum_hidden_threshold` when set. |

#### Two-Pass Exact Gradient Accumulation

Standard gradient accumulation (summing gradients across micro-batches) does not
produce correct gradients for the Sharpe ratio loss because the loss couples all
returns in the batch through shared mean and variance statistics. Naively
accumulating gradients across chunks treats each chunk as independent, introducing
approximation error.

The two-pass scheme in `deepm/training/grad_accum.py` (Appendix B of the
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05975)) solves this exactly:

1. **Pass 1 (no grad):** Stream through all chunks, accumulating the pooled sum
   and sum-of-squares of captured returns across the full batch. If the softmin or
   joint objective is active, per-sample Sharpe ratios and softmin weights are also
   computed. RNG states are saved so that dropout masks can be replayed.

2. **Pass 2 (with grad):** Replay each chunk with the saved RNG states. Using the
   global statistics from Pass 1, analytically derived gradients of the pooled
   Sharpe (and optionally the softmin-weighted per-sample Sharpe) are applied via a
   surrogate backward pass (`(returns * grad).sum().backward()`), producing exact
   parameter gradients identical to what a single full-batch forward/backward would
   yield.

This is triggered automatically when `grad_accum_hidden_threshold` is set: the
batch is split into `hidden_dim // threshold` chunks. For example, with
`hidden_dim: 128` and `grad_accum_hidden_threshold: 64`, the batch is processed in
2 chunks, halving peak memory while preserving exact gradients. All DeePM configs
in this repo use `grad_accum_hidden_threshold: 64`.

### Transaction Costs

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `use_transaction_costs` | bool | Include transaction costs in the loss function (γ > 0 in the paper). |
| `tcost_inputs` | bool | Feed transaction cost estimates as additional model inputs. |
| `fixed_trans_cost_bp_loss` | float | Fixed transaction cost in basis points applied in the loss (0 = use asset-specific estimates from `configs/tcost/`). |
| `volscale_tc_loss` | bool | Scale transaction costs by volatility in the loss. |
| `turnover_regulariser_scaler` | float | Weight on the position-change (turnover) penalty. Corresponds to γ in the paper: 0 = zero cost, 0.5 = half cost (default), 1.0 = full cost. |

| `use_correlation_features` | bool | Compute and include pairwise correlation features. |
| `seq_len` | int | Sequence length (number of time steps per sample). |
| `pre_loss_steps` | int | Number of initial time steps excluded from the loss (burn-in for the model to form internal state before signals are evaluated). |

### Training Loop

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `iterations` | int | Maximum training epochs per seed. |
| `random_search_max_iterations` | int | Number of HP configurations sampled by wandb sweep. |
| `top_n_seeds` | int | Number of top seeds (by validation Sharpe) retained for backtesting. |
| `early_stopping` | int | Stop training if no improvement for this many epochs. |
| `smooth_alpha` | float | EMA smoothing factor for the validation metric (0 < α < 1). Higher = more weight on recent epochs. |
| `min_delta` | float | Minimum improvement in smoothed validation metric to count as progress. |
| `val_burnin_steps` | int | Number of initial epochs to skip before early stopping begins. |
| `train_valid_split` | float | Fraction of the training window used for training (remainder is validation). |

### Asset Universe and Test Windows

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|

| `reference_cols` | list[str] | Non-feature columns carried through the dataset (`["date", "ticker"]`). |

## Backtest Configuration Reference

Each YAML file in `configs/backtest_settings/` defines a backtest run.  All configs
share three top-level keys (`save_path`, `ticker_reference_file`, `data_parquet`),
a `model` block that selects the strategy and its parameters, and a `universe`
block that maps tickers to asset-class groups for diagnostics.

### Top-level

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `save_path` | str | Root directory for backtest prediction outputs (default `backtest_results`). Diagnostics are saved separately under `backtest_diagnostics/`. |
| `ticker_reference_file` | str | Ticker reference in `configs/tcost/` for transaction cost lookup. |
| `data_parquet` | str | Filename of the prepared feature parquet in `data/`. |

### Model block (`model:`)

Settings inside the `model:` block vary by strategy type.  The first four keys
are common to all configs:

## Sweep Configuration Reference

Sweep configs in `configs/sweep_settings/` are standard
[wandb sweep](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps) YAML files.  Each training
config references a sweep via its `sweep_yaml` key.  The sweep defines the
hyperparameter search space; the training config fixes everything else.

Two sweep configs are provided:

| Sweep | Used by | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `sweep-deepm` | All DeePM variants and ablations | Smaller grid (fixed lr, fixed batch size). |
| `sweep-temporal` | Temporal baselines (Momentum Transformer) | Wider lr and batch size ranges. |

### Sweep settings

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `method` | str | Search strategy: `"random"` (random search), `"grid"`, or `"bayes"`. |
| `metric.goal` | str | Optimisation direction: `"maximize"` or `"minimize"`. |
| `metric.name` | str | Metric to optimise (logged by training). `"valid_loss_best"` = best validation Sharpe. |

### Swept hyperparameters (`parameters:`)

| Parameter | `sweep-deepm` | `sweep-temporal` | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `lr` | `[0.0001]` | `[0.0001, 0.0003]` | Learning rate. |
| `batch_size` | `[64]` | `[64, 128]` | Training batch size. |
| `weight_decay` | `[1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3]` | `[1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3]` | AdamW weight decay (L2 regularisation). |
| `max_gradient_norm` | `[0.5, 1.0]` | `[0.5, 1.0]` | Gradient clipping threshold. |
| `dropout` | `[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]` | `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]` | Dropout probability. |
| `hidden_dim` | `[64, 128]` | `[64, 128]` | Hidden dimension of the transformer / GNN layers. |
| `num_heads` | `[2, 4]` | `[4]` | Number of multi-head attention heads. |

The total grid size is `random_search_max_iterations` samples (set in the training
config), and the top `top_n_seeds` configurations (by validation Sharpe) are
retained for backtesting.

## Adding a New Model

The codebase is designed so that new architectures can be added with minimal
boilerplate.  The steps below walk through the process end-to-end.

### 1. Implement the architecture

Create a new file in `deepm/models/` (e.g. `deepm/models/my_model.py`) and
subclass `DeepMomentumNetwork` from `deepm.models.base`:

```python
from deepm.models.base import DeepMomentumNetwork


class MyModel(DeepMomentumNetwork):
    """One-line description of the model."""

    def __init__(self, input_dim, num_tickers, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(input_dim, num_tickers, **kwargs)
        # Build layers here.  Key dimensions are available as:
        #   self.hidden_dim, self.dropout, self.seq_len, self.pre_loss_steps
        # Transaction cost inputs add self.extra_tcost_channels to the
        # feature dimension.  The prediction head (hidden_dim -> position)
        # is already defined in the base class.

    def forward_candidate_arch(self, target_x, target_tickers, **kwargs):
        """Core forward pass: features -> hidden representation.

        Args:
            target_x: Input tensor [B, T, F] (or [B, N, T, F] for cross-section).
            target_tickers: Ticker IDs [B] (or [B, N]).
            **kwargs: Extra inputs (vol_scaling, trans_cost, dates, etc.).

        Returns:
            Hidden tensor of shape [..., T, hidden_dim] which the base class
            feeds through the shared prediction head to produce positions.
        """
        ...

    def variable_importance(self, target_x, target_tickers, **kwargs):
        """Optional: return importance scores."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

The base class handles everything downstream of the hidden representation:
the prediction head (tanh → positions in [-1, 1]), transaction cost
computation, Sharpe-ratio loss (pooled, softmin, or joint), asset dropout,
and position scaling.

If your model operates on the cross-sectional (multi-asset) batch layout,
set `self.is_cross_section = True` in `__init__`.

### 2. Register the architecture

**a) Add to the architecture list** in `deepm/configs/load.py`:

```python
ARCHITECTURES = [
    "LSTM",
    "LSTM_SIMPLE",
    "MOM_TRANS",
    "AdvancedTemporalBaseline",
    "DeePM",
    "MyModel",          # ← add here
]
```

If your model needs architecture-specific defaults (e.g. a different
`cross_section` setting), add them in `load_settings_for_architecture` in
the same file.

**b) Register the class** in `TrainDeepMomentumNetwork.ARCHITECTURE_CLASSES`
(`deepm/training/train.py`):

```python
ARCHITECTURE_CLASSES = {
    "LSTM": LstmBaseline,
    "LSTM_SIMPLE": LstmSimple,
    "DeePM": SpatioTemporalGraphTransformer,
    "AdvancedTemporalBaseline": AdvancedTemporalBaseline,
    "MOM_TRANS": MomentumTransformer,
    "MyModel": MyModel,          # ← add here
}
```

If your model needs extra kwargs injected at construction time (e.g. DeePM
requires `expected_ticker_order` and `ticker_close_rank` from the dataset),
add a `_inject_<name>_kwargs` helper and call it from `_load_architecture`:

```python
def _load_architecture(self, architecture, input_dim, num_tickers, optimise_loss_function, **kwargs):
    cls = self.ARCHITECTURE_CLASSES.get(architecture)
    ...
    if architecture == "MyModel":
        self._inject_mymodel_kwargs(kwargs)
    ...

def _inject_mymodel_kwargs(self, kwargs):
    """Populate any dataset-derived kwargs for MyModel."""
    ref_data = self.valid_data if self.valid_data is not None else self.test_data
    kwargs.setdefault("my_special_param", ref_data.some_attribute)
```

**c) Import** the class at the top of `deepm/training/train.py`:

```python
from deepm.models.my_model import MyModel
```

### 3. Create configuration files

**Training config** — copy an existing config (e.g. `configs/train_settings/deepm-gat.yaml`)
and modify architecture-specific settings.  The `sweep_yaml` key selects the
HP grid; you can reuse an existing sweep or create a new one in
`configs/sweep_settings/`.

**Backtest config** — create a corresponding file in `configs/backtest_settings/`:

```yaml
save_path: backtest_results
ticker_reference_file: futs_and_fx
data_parquet: "data_dec25.parquet"

model:
  module: "deepm.backtest.models.deep_momentum"
  class: "DeepMomentum"
  train_yaml: "my-model"
  architecture: "MyModel"
  top_n_seeds: 25
  seq_len: 84
  pre_loss_steps: 63
  batch_size: 8

universe:
  # ... (copy from an existing config)
```

### 4. Train and evaluate

```bash
# Train
python -m deepm.training -r "my-model" -a MyModel

# Backtest
python -m deepm.backtest --name "bt-my-model" --diagnostics
```
